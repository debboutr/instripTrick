# instripTrick
grab social media photos and videos by location 

stripPict gets exif data using gdal for a point value from a picture

the other scripts grab images off of either Instagram or Flickr within a bounding box

flickr2.py uses a different python module, flickrapi, which can return a more complete dictionary and reduces the number of calls to Flickr, making the colection process faster.
